## Project Description
This is an Angular application where users can create quotes and have those quotes voted on whether they are terrible or are inspirational. Once the user creates a new Quote they can be able to see extra details of the quote which include name of the author & publisher and the days passed from the time it was created. The user can also upvote or downvote a quote based their attitude about the quote. Finally the quote with most upvotes is highlighted.
